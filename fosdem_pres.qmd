## What is R?

- GNU R is a multi-paradigm programming language (first released 1993)
- FLOSS implementation of the S language developed at Bell Labs
- Statistics, machine learning and data science
- Great for visualisation tasks as well
- Built-in objects: data frames, matrices, formulas, models...

## Hello World!

```{r}
life_cycle_savings <- read.csv("life_cycle_savings.csv")

fm1 <- lm(sr ~ pop15 + pop75 + dpi + ddpi, data = LifeCycleSavings)

summary(fm1)
```

## CRAN
